### Product Objectives

The EdTok aims to spread more knowledge in the form of short videos, helping users to utilize their leisure time to gain some interesting things through enjoyable ways.  Users can follow any other users on the platform, find who has followed them and who they are following. Users share their work or expertise by uploading videos to the app and others can find it, respond (similar to a like button) to it if they like it, or make a comment on it. 

### In development

* __Home Page__

  Homepage is to present some basic ideas and some application methods. 

* __Sign in/Sign up Page__

	Sign in/Sign up page is to let user sign in/ sign up into the app

* __User Profile Homepage__

Also, there are some classifications of videos such as science, life and so on. When the user clicks the followers or following button, the user could see the videos uploaded by the follower and following user.
